# A Chore tracking app

Both my boyfriend and I hate chores. 
So we decided to start a point system for most common chores. 
One gets a point everytime one completes a task. 
We tallied our points on a post-it note.

The incentive system is working really well. 
So I started to make a react app linked to a sql database where our points will be saved. 

So far it currently has these features:

1) Chore name
   -input field to change task name
2) Side by side isplay of the number of stars we each have earned (one star for one completed chore)
3) "Count up" button to add a star (with confetti effect) and "undo" button to remove a star if added accidently
4) A bar chart showing who is ahead

Features in progress:
An email reminder for chores to be done at regular interval,for example, washing bedsheets.
